# PDF Master Angular - DocScanner Transformation Requirements

## Project Overview
Transform the current PDF Master Angular application from an "I Love PDF" style tool collection into a comprehensive DocScanner-style application with project-based workflow, document scanning, OCR, and mobile-optimized features.

## Current State

- Collaborative editing

### 8. Advanced Export & Sharing (Priority: LOW)
**Current**: Basic download
**Target**: Rich sharing options
- Multiple export formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, JPEG)
- Email integration with attachments
- Social media sharing
- QR code generation for quick sharing
- Batch export operations

## Technical Architecture Changes

### New Services Required
